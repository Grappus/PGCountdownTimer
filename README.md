# Countdown-Timer
Timer shows days,hours,minutes and seconds.
Note that this timer is build over a custom calendar.So it will be pretty hard to customize this according to your own needs.
Use this timer if and only if you need a timer that shows days,hours,minutes and seconds.
Rest of the implementation is pretty simple.Check the demo project for that.
